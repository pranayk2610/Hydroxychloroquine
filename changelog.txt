Added rememberMe checkbox and functionality (subclassed AuthenticationForm)
Cleaned up urls.py, moving relevent sections to views.py
The views from django.contrib.auth expressed in a more controlable way
added submit buttons to reportTest.html and account.html
Bastardized the formatting in reportTest.html but it can now return the input upto the building select.
